### **A map of Be'er-Sheva streets (left) and light posts (right)**  
*23.11.2019*  
I mapped the streets of Be'er Sheva thanks to [Christian Burkhart](https://ggplot2tutor.com/streetmaps/streetmaps/) blog. Once I mapped the streets (left) I could map the city lights of the city thanks to the municipality's free [open data](https://www.beer-sheva.muni.il/OpenData/Pages/Data.aspx).

### **Mapping bomb shelters in Be'er-Sheva, Israel**  
*12.11.2019*  

In this visualization I mapped the bomb shelters near my neighborhood in Be'er-Sheva. I discovered open data sets from our municpality's website and took the next day's opportunity (missiles fired towards israel) to plot bomb shelters.
