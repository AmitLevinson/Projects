Explore playlist genre by mean duration

```{r}
by_duration <- spotify_songs %>%
    mutate(year = year(as.Date(track_album_release_date, "%Y-%m-%d"))) %>% 
    group_by(playlist_genre,year) %>% 
    summarise_at(vars(duration_ms),list(mean_ = mean, sd_ = sd)) %>% 
    ungroup()

ggplot(by_duration, aes(x = year, y= mean_, fill = playlist_genre, color = playlist_genre, group = playlist_genre))+
    geom_line()+
    theme_light()
```

That's bad and unhelpful, let's try by Explore genre by mean danceability:

```{r}
spotify_songs %>%
  mutate(year = year(as.Date(track_album_release_date, "%Y-%m-%d"))) %>% 
  group_by(playlist_genre,year) %>% 
  summarise_at(vars(danceability),list(mean_ = mean, sd_ = sd)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y= mean_, fill = playlist_genre, color = playlist_genre, group = playlist_genre))+
  geom_line()+
  theme_light()
```

Again, doesn't seem helpful. How about by popularity?

```{r}
spotify_songs_y <- spotify_songs %>%
  mutate(track_year = year(as.Date(track_album_release_date, "%Y-%m-%d"))) 

spotify_pop <- spotify_songs_y %>% 
  group_by(playlist_genre, track_year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_pop = mean(track_popularity),
            count_n = n()) %>%
  filter(track_year >= 2000) %>% 
  ungroup()

ggplot(spotify_pop,aes(x = track_year, y = mean_pop, color = playlist_genre))+
  geom_line()
```

Hmm, What's happenning in edm throughout 2000-2010?

```{r}
spotify_pop %>% 
  filter(playlist_genre == "edm") %>% 
  arrange(track_year) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

Did something happen in playlist_genre of edm from 2009-2010 jumping 19 points?

```{r}
spotify_songs_y %>%
  filter(playlist_genre == "edm", between(track_year, 2009,2010)) %>% 
  arrange(-track_popularity) %>% 
  select(track_year,everything()) %>% 
  head(10)
```

9/10 songs dominant the top 10 songs, did something change?

```{r}
spotify_songs_y %>% 
  filter(playlist_genre == "edm", track_year >= 2008) %>%
  select(danceability, valence, liveness, loudness, track_year) %>% 
  group_by(track_year) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(danceability, valence, liveness, loudness),list(mean = mean, sd = sd)) %>%
  right_join(spotify_pop, by = c("track_year" = "track_year")) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = ends_with("mean"), names_to = "criteria", names_prefix = "_mean") %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = ends_with("sd"), names_to = "criteria_sd", names_prefix = "_mean", values_to = "sd") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = track_year, y = value, color = criteria))+
  geom_line()
```

Not sure,  doesn't seem like a pattern. 


## By Band

It's time to move onto something else. Let's look at the top bands. Top = with the most count of records.


```{r}
by_artist <- spotify_songs_y %>%
  group_by(track_artist) %>%
  filter(n() >= 80) %>% 
  select(track_artist, track_name, track_popularity) %>% 
  distinct(track_artist, track_name, .keep_all = TRUE)

by_artist_mean <- by_artist %>% 
  group_by(track_artist) %>% 
  summarise(popularity = mean(track_popularity)) %>% 
  mutate(track_name = "mean", .before = popularity,
        track_artist = fct_reorder(track_artist, popularity))

ggplot(by_artist, aes(y = track_artist, x = track_popularity))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_point(data = by_artist_mean, aes(y = track_artist, x = popularity), color = "red")+
    theme(
      panel.background = element_blank())
```

Hmm, again, we see some variance in between bands and artist, for example Drake doesn't have a song too close to the mean. Queen all in all have an OK average compared to the rest but with a distribution somewhat across it with classics ranked high.  

Let's turn to look at difference from mean and see if there's a pattern according to when the song was released.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
by_artist_mean <- by_artist %>% 
  group_by(track_artist) %>% 
  summarise(popularity = mean(track_popularity)) %>% 
  top_n(7) %>% 
  pull(track_artist)

artist_songs <- spotify_songs %>% 
  filter(track_artist %in% by_artist_mean) %>% 
  mutate(track_date = as.Date(track_album_release_date, "%Y-%m-%d")) %>%
  distinct(track_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  arrange(track_date) %>%
  select(track_artist, track_name, track_popularity, track_date) %>% 
  add_count(track_artist) %>% 
  group_by(track_artist) %>% 
  mutate(song_seq = seq(1,length(track_name), 1),.before = track_popularity,
         mean_pop = mean(track_popularity),
         mean_diff = mean_pop - track_popularity,
         val = ifelse(mean_diff >0, "pos", "neg")) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(track_artist = fct_reorder(track_artist, n))


ggplot(artist_songs, aes(x = song_seq, y = mean_diff, fill = val))+
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(~ track_artist, scales = "free", ncol = 1)+
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(pos = "#919c4c", neg = "#c03728"))+
  labs(title = "Band Song Popularity", subtitle = "Songs' difference from mean from the first to the last song released. Left side of X axis is the first\nsong released moving right in a chronological order, where the right side is the last song released.\nThe bands (according to avergae) out of those with 80 records were chosen\n",
    x = "Chronological order of songs", y = NULL)+
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "Roboto Condensed", hjust = 0.5),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 13, color = "grey50", hjust = 0.5),
    strip.text = element_text(size = 14, color = "grey25"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#F5F5F5"),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12, color = "grey50"),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_blank())

ggsave("plot.png", height = 16, width = 12)
```

Not too bad with some things we saw previously such as Drake's high variance and Martin Garrix with also a large difference between his first to last songs.
